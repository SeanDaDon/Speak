    <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
        This page is intended to be a user guide on how to utilize the various functionalities of this web application.
        You will notice that there is black bar at the top of this page with two white words. Each of these words is a button
        which will take you to a different page.

        The 'Voice' tab is the main page used to control the toy. It has two buttons, 'Microphone' and 'Pressure Sensor.'
        Pressing 'Microphone' will begin the toy's speech recognition and it will start listening for known commands. Once
        a command is spoken and recognized (indicated by a light) the toy will respond with a movement. Pressing 'Pressure Sensor'
        will allow the toy to respond to an input from a pressure sensor pad (this mimics the use of a tongue depressor)
        which are located inside the mouth.

        The 'Speaker' tab is used to output affirmation phrases. Selecting one of the four buttons will output that phrase to the speaker 
        located within the toy.
